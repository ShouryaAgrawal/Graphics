        <p>This workbook is due on Monday, March 7, 2022.</p>
<h2>Learning Goals</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Learn how to implement a basic UI</li>
    <li>To practice some key computations with curves.</li>
    <li>To implement various aspects of curves in the context of an application.</li>
    <li>To appreciate why curve concepts, such as arc length parameterization and smoothness, are useful.</li>
    <li>To write an interesting graphics program.</li>
</ol>

            <p><strong>This workbook is for advanced points only</strong></p>
<p>This workbook continues our study of curves in 2D. Last week&rsquo;s workbook went through the key ideas. This week, we&rsquo;ll put those ideas into action in a programming assignment: making a train that goes around a track.</p>
<p>Unlike all other workbooks, this workbook only has advanced points. If you are satisfied with your grade without earning advanced points, you can consider this workbook optional. However, even if you choose not to do this workbook, you should still read through it: the concepts discussed will help you understand curves better.</p>
<p>You should also note that the &ldquo;basic&rdquo; parts of this assignment (the things that were basic points in last year&rsquo;s version of the class), are worth a very small amount of advanced points this year. It&rsquo;s a lot of work for a few points. But it&rsquo;s worth it.</p>
<p>In the past, students have found the train to be a fun and rewarding assignment. But we decided to try making it &ldquo;advanced only&rdquo; this year because we didn&rsquo;t want to have a hard workbook required right before the midterm.</p>
<p>Note that this workbook has a non-standard late policy. The due date is Monday (March 7), as usual. However, since there are only advanced points in this workbook, you can still earn advanced points if you turn the workbook in on or before Friday, March 11th. Assignments turned in after this date must apply for &ldquo;very late&rdquo; grading.</p>
<h2 id="required-reading">Required Reading</h2>
<p>There is no new required reading for this week. The readings on curves were part of Workbook 5. You may want to review these readings (including the workbook itself). If you haven&rsquo;t read them, now is a good time to do it. Doing the train will require you to understand the key concepts of curves. Some curve topics are less important for the train, but will come back on exams, or, if you ever do something in computer graphics beyond class.</p>
<p><strong>Textbook:</strong> Curves are covered in <a href="https://canvas.wisc.edu/files/23924298/download?download_frd=1">FCG4_Ch15.pdf (0.5mb)</a>.   We won&rsquo;t cover all the material in class. The sections are:</p>
<ol>
<li>FCG 15.1 - basic ideas of curves, including parameterizations and piecewise representations</li>
<li>FCG 15.2 - curve properties (especially continuity)</li>
<li>FCG 15.3 - polynomial pieces - you need to have the basic intuitions, however, you will not need to do the derivations yourself.</li>
<li>FCG 15.4 - putting pieces together - this makes things sound more complicated than they are</li>
<li>FCG 15.5 - cubics - you&rsquo;ll need cardinals for the train</li>
<li>FCG 15.6.1 - Bézier curves - very important, since they are what gets used in Canvas and many other things.</li>
<li>FCG 15.6.2 - B-Spline curves - (and 15.6.3 and 15.6.4 which are advanced kinds of B-Spline curves) is optional.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="https://canvas.wisc.edu/files/23924312/download?download_frd=1">Hart20-jan19.pdf (2.4mb)</a> covers much of the same material in a different way. You should read this to clarify and reinforce the required material above.</p>
<ol>
<li>Hart 20.0 - basics of curves, a good review of the terms discussed in FCG 15.1-15.3</li>
<li>Hart 20.1 - the wiggle theorem - make sure you have the intuition that an nth degree polynomial has (at most) n-1 wiggles.</li>
<li>Hart 20.2 - Lagrangian curves - this is also 15.3.6 in FCG - understand the basic idea to know why we don&rsquo;t use these things.</li>
<li>Hart 20.3 - Hermite curves - these are in 15.3.4 and 15.5.2 of FCG. You won&rsquo;t need to derive them, but understanding what they are will be useful for Beziers and Cardinals, which we will use a lot.</li>
<li>Hart 20.4 - Bézier curves - these are important, so seeing them more than once may help.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="rubrics-for-grading">Rubrics for Grading</h2>
<p>Note: some of the rubric items have zero points. In prior years, these earned basic points. You still need to do these items because they are required for the more advanced features that do earn points.</p>
